# Interactive Crypto Tax Tool - CSV to IRS Form 8949

## Overview

This project demonstrates how generative AI can be used to rapidly prototype a practical data transformation tool. It allows users to upload a CSV or Excel file of cryptocurrency transactions, map their columns to the required IRS Form 8949 inputs, and generates a downloadable Excel file formatted for capital gains tax reporting. The tool was built through prompt-driven collaboration with Claude (Anthropic AI).

## Business Context

Cryptocurrency investors often receive transaction history from multiple sources- wallets, exchanges, and platforms-each with its own inconsistent CSV format. Preparing these for IRS Form 8949 typically requires tedious manual cleanup. This project addresses that problem by enabling users to map their CSV headers to standard Form 8949 fields and instantly export a compliant Excel file. It's especially helpful for users with large numbers of transactions, now required to be reported line by line under new tax regulations.

## My Role

- Defined the tool’s core functionality and user flow
- Created a sample CSV structure to simulate real crypto data
- Outlined the desired format for the Excel export (Form 8949)
- Designed and refined prompts for Claude to generate the interface and logic
- Tested and iterated on the AI-generated output using mock data

Note: I did not manually write the code. The interface and logic were generated by Claude based on my prompts, examples, and specifications.

## AI Collaboration (Claude)

Using Claude and thorough prompt engineering, I generated:

- A simple HTML/JS interface for uploading files and mapping fields
- Python scripts for transforming the data
- Logic for exporting to Excel in IRS-compliant format

This project highlights how AI-assisted development can turn clear prompts and structured input into functional tools.

## Key Features

- Upload a CSV or Excel file with transaction history (mock data shown)
- Map user-provided columns to IRS Form 8949 fields
- Export a clean Excel file formatted for capital gains reporting
- Entire tool generated using AI based on prompt engineering

## Technologies Used (via Claude-generated Code)

- HTML/CSS/JS for front-end UI
- Python with pandas and openpyxl for CSV data processing and Excel generation
- Mock crypto transaction data for testing and demonstration

## Debugging Note

During testing, I encountered an issue where uploaded CSV files weren’t parsing correctly—every row appeared as a single column of text. This was due to improper formatting in the mock data: although saved as .csv, the file lacked proper comma separation and UTF-8 encoding.

To resolve this, I:

- Re-exported the mock file with correct delimiters and encoding
- Verified that the tool could read it directly, without requiring Excel’s “Text to Columns” step
- Ensured compatibility with the Python CSV parser used in the Claude-generated code

This improved the reliability of the demo and better reflected how real-world data would be handled in production.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Prompt engineering and iterative AI collaboration
- Testing real-world compliance needs into a functional prototype
- Testing and validating AI-generated code

## Try It

- Download the mock CSV
- Open the interface demo (locally)
- Generate an example output

## Disclaimer

This project uses mock data and is not intended for real tax reporting.
